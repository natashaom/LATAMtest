# LATAM Code Test Page

After following the requirements sent by email and the PSD assets, here is the result. I used Bootstrap and SCSS to optimize the styling and structure of the components. Also created the following interactive components mentioned in the email:

- A hamburger menu for mobile devices
- An image carousel on one of the blog posts
